# PS 2: Causal Inference

Using data from the [Progresa program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oportunidades), a government social assistance program in Mexico, the goal is to implement some econometric techniques (i.e. differences-in-differences) to measure the impact of Progresa on secondary school enrollment rates.

The timeline of the program was:
- Baseline survey conducted in 1997
- Intervention begins in 1998, "Wave 1" of data collected in 1998
- "Wave 2 of data" collected in 1999
- Evaluation ends in 2000, at which point the control villages were treated.

## Part 1: Descriptive Analysis
Reports summary statistics, difference at baseline, and graphical exploration.

## Part 2: Measuring Impact
Our goal is to estimate the causal impact of the Progresa program on the social and economic
outcomes of individuals in Mexico. We will focus on the impact of the program on the poor (those
with poor==’pobre’), since only the poor were eligible to receive the Progresa assistance.

Reports results of cross-sectional estimator t-test, regression, multiple regression, difference-in-difference.
