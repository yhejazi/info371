# PS 4: k-NN & TF-IDF Text Classification

In this project, I programmed k-NN with cosine similarity using both bag-of-words and TF-IDF approaches. The goal was to implement these approaches from scratch and compare performance.

This project uses two datasets: first, various texts from Cantenbury corpus with several books added from Project Gutenberg, and thereafter, Rotten Tomatoes, brief movie reviews. In case of the texts, my goal was to find the correct source of the text. In case of tomatoes, my goal was to predict if the review is for a "rotten" or"fresh" movie.
