# PS 1: Statistics and Linear Algebra Demonstration

The task is to conduct a series of MC simulations and see how wide interval will fit most of the results. Then, we explore linear transformations of images with matrix multiplication and rotation matrix.

**Part 1**: Outliers in different distributions
We generate a large numer **R** or random samples given size **n** to simulate Normal distribution, then compare means, standard deviations, and confidence intervals. Then we do the same thing for Pareto distribution to compare.

**Part 2**: Linear transformation of images
We explore matrix multiplication and rotation matrix to tranform matrices and images.
