# Projects from INFO 371: Advanced Methods in Data Science
Introduces modern methods in applied data science. Emphasizes practical applications and analysis of real-world data through a survey of common techniques in supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and methods for experimental design and causal inference. Includes functional, procedural, and statistical programming techniques for working with data.

## PS 1: Statistics and Linear Algebra Demonstration
The task is to conduct a series of MC simulations and see how wide interval will fit most of the results. Then, we explore linear transformations of images with matrix multiplication and rotation matrix.

## PS 2: Causal Inference
Using data from the [Progresa program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oportunidades), a government social assistance program in Mexico, the goal is to implement some econometric techniques (i.e. differences-in-differences) to measure the impact of Progresa on secondary school enrollment rates.

## PS 3: Boston Housing Dataset EDA
This is a notebook with the purpose of conducting an EDA Using the [Boston Housing Prices Data Set](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html) in order to ensure understanding of Python/Pandas.

## PS 4: k-NN Text Classification
I programmed k-NN with cosine similarity using both bag-of-words and TF-IDF approaches. The goal was to implement these approaches from scratch and compare performance.

## PS 5: Logistic Regression, SVM, Classification
My goal was to explore estimators and feature engineering using k-NN, logistic regression, support vector machines, & ROC curves. This project works with Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) to predict diagnosis of tumors. 

## PS 6: Naive Bayes
I used the Rotton Tomatoes dataset to implement my own Naive Bayes algorithm to categorize the quotes into rotten/fresh, and find the optimal smoothing parameters with my own k-fold cross validation. I also implemented the three-fold data split with test data set aside for the final performance measure only.

## Final
This notebook is a final exam that covers implementation of multiple regression techniques in Part 1 and text classification in Part 2.
