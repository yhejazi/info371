# PS 6: Naive Bayes

In this notebook, I use the Rotton Tomatoes dataset to implement my own Naive Bayes algorithm to categorize the quotes into rotten/fresh, and find the optimal smoothing parameters with my own k-fold cross validation. I also implement the three-fold data split with test data set aside for the final performance measure only.
